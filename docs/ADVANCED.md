## Advanced Usage ##
This section shows several of the advanced functions of the container, as well as how to build a container
from the github repo.

** Note: ** Not all sections below will leave your container in a supported state. See `docs/SETUP.md` for the list of officially supported configurations.

##### Building From Source (Unsupported) #####
1. Download the Splunk Docker GitHub repository to your local development environment:
```
git clone https://github.com/splunk/docker-splunk
```
The supplied `Makefile` located inside the root of the project provides the ability to download any of the remaining
components.

** WARNING:** Modifications to the "base" image may result in Splunk being unable to start or run correctly.

3. To complete the creation of the `splunk:latest` image, run the following in the project root directory:
```
make splunk
```

## Advanced Configurations ##
Splunk's Docker container has several functions that can be configured. These options are specified by either supplying a `default.yml` file or
by passing in environment variables. Below is a list of environment variables that may/must be used when starting the docker container.

#### default.yml valid options
`default.yml` exposes several additional options for configuring Splunk, and may be set by either mounting a volume to `/tmp/defaults` or by setting the
`SPLUNK_DEFAULTS_URL` environment token. A sample `default.yml` file can be generated by following the instructions [here](#generating-a-defaultyml-file).

Root items influence the behavior of everything in the container; they have global scope inside the container.
Example:
```
    ---
    retry_num: 100
```

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| retry_num | Default number of loop attempts to connect containers | none | 100 | yes | yes | yes |

The major object "splunk" in the YAML file will contain variables that influence how Splunk operates. Example:
```
    splunk:
        opt: /opt
        home: /opt/splunk
        user: splunk
        group: splunk
        exec: /opt/splunk/bin/splunk
        pid: /opt/splunk/var/run/splunk/splunkd.pid
        password: "{{ splunk_password | default(<password>) }}"
        svc_port: 8089

        http_port: 8000
        hec_port: 8088
        hec_disabled: 0
        hec_enableSSL: 1
        # The hec_token here is used for INGESTION only. By that I mean receiving Splunk events.
        # Setting up your environment to forward events out of the cluster is another matter entirely
        hec_token: <default_hec_token>
        # This option here is to enable the SmartStore feature
        smartstore: null
```

| Variable Name | Description | Parent Object | Default Value | Required for Standalone | Required for Search Head Clustering | Required for Index Clustering |

| smartstore | Configuration params for [SmartStore](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore) bootstrapping | splunk | null | no | no | no |

The app_paths section is located as part of the "splunk" parent object. The settings located in this section will directly influence how apps are installed inside the container. Example:
```
        app_paths:
            default: /opt/splunk/etc/apps
            shc: /opt/splunk/etc/shcluster/apps
            idxc: /opt/splunk/etc/master-apps
            httpinput: /opt/splunk/etc/apps/splunk_httpinput
```

| Variable Name | Description | Parent Object | Default Value | Required for Standalone | Required for Search Head Clustering | Required for Index Clustering |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| default | Normal apps for standalone instances will be installed in this location | splunk.app_paths | **none** | no | no | no |
| shc | Apps for search head cluster instances will be installed in this location (usually only done on the deployer)| splunk.app_paths | **none** | no | no | no |
| idxc | Apps for index cluster instances will be installed in this location (usually only done on the cluster master)| splunk.app_paths | **none** | no | no | no |
| httpinput | App to use and configure when setting up HEC based instances.| splunk.app_paths | **none** | no | no | no |

Search Head Clustering can be configured using the "shc" sub-object. Example:
```
        # Search Head Clustering
        shc:
            enable: false
            secret: <secret_key>
            replication_factor: 3
            replication_port: 4001
```
| Variable Name | Description | Parent Object | Default Value | Required for Standalone | Required for Search Head Clustering | Required for Index Clustering |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| replication_port | Default port for the SHC to communicate on | splunk.shc | 4001 | no | yes | no |

Lastly, Index Clustering is configured with the `idxc` sub-object. Example:
```
        # Indexer Clustering
        idxc:
            secret: <secret_key>
            search_factor: 2
            replication_factor: 3
            replication_port: 9887
```

| replication_factor | Bucket replication factor used between index peers | splunk.idxc | 3 | no | no | yes |
| replication_port | Bucket replication Port between index peers | splunk.idxc | 9887 | no | no | yes |

#### Enabling SmartStore
SmartStore utilizes S3-compliant object storage in order to store indexed data. This is a capability only available if you're using an indexer cluster (cluster_master + indexers). For more information, please see the [blog post](https://www.splunk.com/blog/2018/10/11/splunk-smartstore-cut-the-cord-by-decoupling-compute-and-storage.html) as well as [technical overview](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/AboutSmartStore).

This docker image is capable of support SmartStore, as long as you bring-your-own backend storage provider. Due to the complexity of this option, this is only enabled if you specify all the parameters in your `default.yml` file. 

Here's an overview of what this looks like if you want to persist *all* your indexes (default) with a SmartStore backend:
```
---
splunk:
  smartstore:
    - indexName: default
      remoteName: remote_store
      scheme: s3
      remoteLocation: <bucket-name>
      s3:
        access_key: <access_key>
        secret_key: <secret_key>
        endpoint: http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  ...
```

---

## Generating a default.yml file ##
The Docker Container contains a script for the generation of random keys, hec tokens, or passwords, and echoes them to stdout.  Run the following command to
generate a set of defaults that you can use in your environment

```
$ docker run --rm splunk/splunk-debian-9:latest create-defaults > test_scenarios/defaults/default.yml
```

you can also pre-seed the password in your default file:

```
$ docker run --rm -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=<password>" splunk/splunk-debian-9:latest create-defaults > <fullpath_to_images_repo>/test_scenarios/defaults/default.yml
```

## Starting Splunk Enterprise with a default.yml file ##
The following command is used to supply an advanced configuration to the container, specify a url location of the `default.yml` file, or volume mount in a default. To use the
`default.yml` created on the previous section, use the following syntax:

```
$ docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -v <fullpath_to_images_repo>/test_scenarios/defaults:/tmp/defaults -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" -e "SPLUNK_PASSWORD=<password>" splunk/splunk-debian-9:latest
```


# Starting a Splunk Cluster

** Note: ** Splunk does not offer support for Docker or any orchestration
platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Mesos, etc. Support covers only the
published Splunk Docker images. At this time, we strongly recommend that only
very experienced and advanced customers use Docker to run Splunk clusters*

While Splunk does not support orchestrators or the YAML templates required to
deploy and manage clusters and other advanced configurations, we provide several
examples of these different configurations in the "test_scenarios" folder. These are for prototyping purposes only.
One of the most common configurations of Splunk Enterprise is the C3 configuration
(see [Splunk Validated Architectures](https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/white-papers/splunk-validated-architectures.pdf) for more info).
This architecture contains a search head cluster, an index cluster, with a deployer and cluster master.

You can create a simple cluster with Docker Swarm using the following command:
```
 $> SPLUNK_COMPOSE=cluster_absolute_unit.yaml make sample-compose-up
```
Please note that the provisioning process will run for a few minutes after this command completes
while the Ansible plays run. Also, be warned that this configuration requires a lot of resources
so running this on your laptop may make it hot and slow.

To view port mappings run:
```
 $> docker ps
```
After several minutes, you should be able to log into one of the search heads `sh#`
using the default username `admin` and the password you input at installation, or set through the Splunk UI.

Once finished, you can remove the cluster by running:
```
 $> SPLUNK_COMPOSE=cluster_absolute_unit.yaml make sample-compose-down
```

The `cluster_absolute_unit.yaml` file located in the test_scenarios folder is a
Docker Compose file that can be used to mimic this type of deployment.

```
version: "3.6"

networks:
  splunknet:
    driver: bridge
    attachable: true
```

`version 3.6` is a reference to the Docker Compose version, while `networks` is a reference to the type of adapter that will be created for
the Splunk deployment to communicate across. For more information on the different types of network drivers, please consult your Docker installation manual.

In `cluster_absolute_unit.yaml`, all instances of Splunk Enterprise are created under one major service object.

```
services:
  sh1:
    networks:
      splunknet:
        aliases:
          - sh1
    image: splunk/splunk:latest
    hostname: sh1
    container_name: sh1
    environment:
      - SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license
      - SPLUNK_INDEXER_URL=idx1,idx2,idx3,idx4
      - SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_URL=sh2,sh3
      - SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_CAPTAIN_URL=sh1
      - SPLUNK_CLUSTER_MASTER_URL=cm1
      - SPLUNK_ROLE=splunk_search_head_captain
      - SPLUNK_DEPLOYER_URL=dep1
      - SPLUNK_LICENSE_URI=<license uri> http://foo.com/splunk.lic
      - DEBUG=true
    ports:
      - 8000
    volumes:
      - ./defaults:/tmp/defaults
```
It's important to understand how Docker knows how to configure each major container. Below is the above template broken down into its simplest components:

```
services:
  <hostname of container>:
    networks:
      <name of network created in the first section>:
        aliases:
          - <a short name to reference this container>
    image: <what image to use for creating this container>
    hostname: <actual hostname of the container to use>
    container_name: <labeling the container>
    environment:
      - SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license <required in order to start container>
      - SPLUNK_INDEXER_URL=<list of each indexer's hostname>
      - SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_URL= <list of each search head's hostnames>
      - SPLUNK_SEARCH_HEAD_CAPTAIN_URL=<hostname of which container to make the captain>
      - SPLUNK_CLUSTER_MASTER_URL=<hostname of the cluster master>
      - SPLUNK_ROLE=<what role to use for this container>
      - SPLUNK_DEPLOYER_URL=<hostname of the deployer>
      - SPLUNK_LICENSE_URI=<uri to your Splunk Enterprise license>
      - DEBUG=<true/false>
    ports:
      - 8000 <port to expose to the host>
    volumes:
      - ./defaults:/tmp/defaults <only used for volume mapping a default.yml>

```

Acceptable roles for SPLUNK_ROLE are as follows:
* splunk_standalone
* splunk_search_head
* splunk_indexer
* splunk_deployer
* splunk_license_master
* splunk_cluster_master
* splunk_heavy_forwarder

For more information about these roles, refer to [Splunk Splexicon](https://docs.splunk.com/splexicon).

After creating a Compose file, you can start an entire cluster with `docker-compose`:
```
docker-compose -f cluster_absolute_unit.yaml up -d
```

To support Splunk Enterprise's complex configurations, the Docker container utilizes Ansible which performs the required provisioning
commands. You can use the `docker log` command to follow these logs.

`docker ps` will show a list of all the current running instances on this node. The cluster master gives the best indication of cluster health without needing to check every container.
```
$ docker ps
```
```

```
Follow the stdout from the cluster master by running the following command:
```
docker logs -f <container-id>
```
In the above example, the container id is `bbbe650dd544`. So, the `docker logs` command would be run as follows:
```
docker logs -f bbbe650dd544
```
As Ansible runs, the results from each play can be seen on the screen as well as writen to an ansible.log file stored inside the container.

It's important to call out the `RECAP` line, as it's the biggest indicator if Splunk Enterprise was configured correctly. In this
example, there was a failure during the container creation. The offending play is:

```

```

In the above example, the `default.yml` file didn't contain a password, nor was an environment variable set.

Please see the [troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) section for more common issues that can occur. There you will also find instructions for producing Splunk diagnostics for support such as `splunk diag`, as well as instructions for downloading the full Splunk `ansible.log` file.
